My name is Meir Schochet, and I'm a first year PhD student in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Michigan State University. I am currently working under the guidance of Dr. Adina Feinstein on young stellar activity and other forms of observable stellar phenomena. Before moving to East Lansing, I graduated Summa Cum Laude with my B.S. in Astrophysics and a minor in Philosophy from the University of Florida.
